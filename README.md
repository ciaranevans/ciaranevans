![Me talking about Mangroves](https://github.com/ciaranevans/ciaranevans/blob/main/mangroves.jpg?raw=true)

Hi there! My name's Ciaran (_That's me_ ☝️)
I'm an Engineer based in the UK 🇬🇧 (_I ❤️ the 🇪🇺 and miss them_). 

I've just joined [Reliably](https://reliably.com/) where I'll be maintaining [Chaos Toolkit](https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit)!

_Live scenes of me Chaos Engineering - 2021_

Previously I built serverless awesomeness in AWS @ [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org) to help people like [NASA](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/hls-sentinel2-downloader-serverless) and [Pangeo Forge](https://github.com/ciaranevans?from=2021-07-01&to=2021-07-12&org=pangeo-forge&year_list=1) make the most of their Earth Observation data! 🛰🌍

I also worked @ the [UKHO](https://www.admiralty.co.uk/) where I created the [Global Mangrove coverage dataset](https://medium.com/uk-hydrographic-office/creating-a-global-dataset-using-serverless-applications-and-deep-learning-c4e267fa810c?source=friends_link&sk=37ab5a146ad07c93afa63382fa44ad67), scaled deep learning models across the world, processed global shipping traffic, automated tidal analysis, and produced a Hadoop-based geospatial data engine.
